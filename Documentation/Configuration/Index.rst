Configuration
=============

When the `admPanel` property is set, the Admin Panel displays at the bottom of
pages on the frontend. See the :ref:`admPanel section of the TypoScript
Template Reference<t3tsref:setup-config-admpanel>` for more information.

You also need to set the User TSconfig to enable the panel for the user. See
the :ref:`admPanel section of the TSconfig Reference<t3tsconfig:useradmpanel>`
for more information.
